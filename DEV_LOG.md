## [2026-05-03] - Project Initialization & Wiki Setup

### 🎯 Objective
Initialize the `MeetingSummary` project with a robust Knowledge Base (Wiki) structure based on the `SkillsBuilder` architecture (Karpathy LLM Wiki pattern).

### 📝 Task List
- [x] Create `wiki/` structure (`SCHEMA.md`, `index.md`, `log.md`).
- [x] Define initial concepts: `meeting-summarization`, `llm-wiki`.
- [x] Establish `raw/` directory for source materials.
- [x] Initialize `DEV_LOG.md` (this file).
- [x] Initialize frontend framework (Vite + React + TS).
- [x] Implement Premium UI/UX with "Color Master Palette" and Glassmorphism.
- [x] Implement core recording logic using MediaRecorder API.
- [x] Pivot to **Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash** (Native Audio Support).
- [x] Integrate `@google/generative-ai` SDK.
- [x] Implement Embedded User Guide in UI (Initial State).
- [x] Implement Multi-Provider API Selector (Gemini, AssemblyAI, Deepgram).
- [x] Optimize Gemini Prompt to **v2.0** (Professional Structured Output in zh-TW).
- [x] Implement **Meeting History Persistence** (localStorage).
- [x] Add **History UI** (List view, Item loading, Delete functionality).
- [x] Implement **Export Functionality** (Markdown Download, PDF Print).
- [x] Enhance **Microphone Error Handling** (Specific advice for NotFound/NotAllowed).
- [ ] Implement actual API callers for AssemblyAI and Deepgram.

### 🔍 Analysis (RCA - Root Cause Analysis)
- **Problem**: GitHub Actions build failed with a TypeScript error.
- **Root Cause**: A type mismatch occurred in `App.tsx` because the `transcript` state was changed from an array to a string, but a legacy function (`addMockTranscript`) still attempted to update it as an array.
- **Solution**: Removed all legacy transcription logic and ensured the state is handled consistently as a string, aligning with the Gemini API response format. Verified the fix using `npx tsc` locally.
- **Problem**: Microphone access fails with `NotFoundError`.
- **Root Cause**: No physical microphone connected or browser unable to access the device due to OS-level privacy settings.
- **Solution**: Improved error handling to provide actionable advice (check hardware, check Windows privacy settings, check browser permissions). Added safety checks for `navigator.mediaDevices`.
- **Problem (Legacy)**: Traditional STT (like OpenAI Whisper) often requires a separate diarization step.
- **Root Cause**: Audio and text models are usually disjoint.
- **Solution**: Gemini 1.5 Pro allows "Native Multimodal Reasoning", where the model listens to the audio and writes the diarized transcript directly, eliminating the need for complex pipeline orchestration.

### 🛡️ CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Actions)
- **Corrective**: Built a robust frontend state machine that handles the recording lifecycle and provides mock diarization for UI testing.
- **Preventive**: Will implement a "Processing" state to handle long-running cloud transcription tasks without blocking the UI.
